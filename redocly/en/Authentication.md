# Authentication

To access the Intercom API, you have two authentication options depending on whether you app is public or private.

An Access Token is for if you're using the API to access data in your own Intercom workspace, in other words, building a private app.
OAuth is for if you're building a public app that accesses other people's Intercom data.

## Access Tokens

Access Tokens can be used for the following cases:

- You want to use the API to build a private Intercom app
- You want to run scripts to create or get data from your Intercom workspace
- You want to use the API to programmatically automate certain actions in your Intercom workspace

In all of these cases, the data you are accessing is your own team's customer data.

## How to get your Access Token

We provide you with an Access Token as soon as you create an app on your workspace.

You can find your Access Token in the Configure > Authentication section in your app within the Developer Hub.
