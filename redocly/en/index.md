# Getting started

The Intercom Developer Platform is a suite of SDKs and APIs for building apps that connect with Intercom. You can use these apps to extend the functionality of Intercom or to integrate Intercom with other services.
For more information about Intercom products, visit our main website or read our user documentation.

## Install Intercom

Install the Messenger into your product for web or mobile. This will allow your customers to send messages to your Intercom Inbox and provide a way for you to test Messenger integrations.

You can also:

- Make customizations to the Messenger
  ^ Set up identity verification
  ^ Enable push notifications for iOS, Android, and React Native.

## For Public App Developers

Public apps (sometimes referred to as integrations) are apps that are available for any customer to install. These apps have access to other peoples' Intercom data, which means there are specific requirements in order to publish them, such as setting up OAuth and submitting to the Intercom team for review.
